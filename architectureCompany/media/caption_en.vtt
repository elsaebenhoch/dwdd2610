00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.120
if you're looking for some nearby hikes

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.480
to do there's a couple I can see just

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.880
from my window at home we're looking at

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.360
the uo wasach cash national forest and

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.280
the first hike is the G hike this Trail

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.519
is just under 2 miles and is a moderate

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.439
hike they'll gain a lot of elevation in

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.640
the beginning but as the hike goes down

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.960
the incline gets a little more gradual

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.039
at the end of the trail you'll be right

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.720
at the G and you can climb up to the top

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.199
of it if you want this Trail is very

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.320
exposed so you want to do it early in

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.880
the morning or later in the day this

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.440
hike is to do at Sunset since you'll be

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.320
looking West and overlooking the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.440
mountains in Utah Lake another hike you

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.039
can do here is Mount tonog which is a

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.719
little bit more strenuous this Trail is

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.160
just over 14 M long and along the way

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.559
you gain 4 and 1/2 th000 ft in elevation

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.640
gain but while hiking you'll come across

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.480
beautiful wild flowers and some Wildlife

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.559
too like mountain goats if you're lucky

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.359
although it's a hard hike getting to the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.280
top is very rewarding because you'll get

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:03.039
views of Utah Lake proo Canyon and Lake

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.600
this hike is a full day trip but some

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.960
people will camp in the mountains to

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.960
break it into a multi-day hike
